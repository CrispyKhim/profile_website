# Profile Website

Uhhh... This was for DevSoc Training Program 25T1 Trainee Application.
Theme was **Around the World**.
**Link to website: https://crispykhim.github.io/profile_website/**

My "creative" interpretation of the theme was originally going to be a vinyl display and record player, where the cover images and songs were represented by different parts of the world. 
Then I had the sudden realisation that I was bad at web development, so I leaned towards developing the website similar to that of a photo album (props to Omori for inspiration).
The background represents parts of the world (I suppose) and the images are stylised to be like a polaroid picture frame, where some vary in text and images.

I hope this "creative" interpretation was understandable cause I had no idea how to add some parts to make the website legible...
